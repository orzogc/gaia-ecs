To prepare a docker container inside the "docker" folder run:
```bash
bash ./setup.sh
```

If bash if your default shell it is enough to run:
```bash
./setup.sh
```

Once done, you can build the project using both Clang and GCC by running:
```bash
./build.sh
```

For Clang-only build run:
```bash
./build_clang.sh
```

For GCC-only build run:
```bash
./build_gcc.sh
```
