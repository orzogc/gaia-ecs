# Contributing

Thank you all who decided to contribute to the `Gaia-ECS` project :)<br/>
There are several ways to contribute. Following are a few points helping you on your contribution jurney:

* Before asking a question, please make sure it has not been answered already by searching
  on GitHub under [issues](https://github.com/richardbiely/gaia-ecs/issues). Also, do not
  forget to search among the closed ones. If you are unable to find a proper answer, feel
  free to [open a new issue](https://github.com/richardbiely/gaia-ecs/issues/new).

* If you want to fix a typo in the inline documentation or in the README file, if you want
  to add some new section or improve these in any ways imaginable, please open a new
  [pull request](https://github.com/richardbiely/gaia-ecs/pulls).

* If you found a bug, please make sure a similar one has not already been reported or answered
  by searching on GitHub under [issues](https://github.com/richardbiely/gaia-ecs/issues).
  If you are unable to find an open issue addressing your issue, feel free to
  [open a new one](https://github.com/richardbiely/gaia-ecs/issues/new). Please, do not forget
  to carefully describe how to reproduce the issue and add all the information about the system
  on which you are experiencing it and point out the version of `Gaia-ECS` you use (tag or commit).

* If you found a bug and you wrote a patch to fix it, open a new
  [pull request](https://github.com/richardbiely/gaia-ecs/pulls) with your code. Please, also add some tests
  to avoid any regressions in the future if possible.

* If you want to propose a new feature and you know how to code it, please do not a pull request directly.
  Rather than that, [create a new issue](https://github.com/richardbiely/gaia-ecs/issues/new) to discuss
  your proposal. Other users could be interested in your idea and the discussion that will follow can refine
  it further and therefore give us a better solution overall.

* If you want to request a new feature or a change which is not targeted for the open-source audience, you
  can reach out to me via the email address which can be found on [my profile page](https://github.com/richardbiely)
  and we can discuss hiring me.
